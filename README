# UART-I2C-SPI-CAN-PROTOCALS

A collection of **embedded C programs** demonstrating the implementation of **UART, I2C, SPI, and CAN communication protocols** using **register-level programming**.  
This repository is focused on **LPC21xx (ARM7) microcontrollers** and is useful for **embedded systems learning, interview preparation, and hands-on practice**.

## 📌 Overview

Communication protocols are a core part of embedded systems.  
This repository provides practical examples to understand:

- Register-level peripheral configuration  
- Pin Connect Block (PCB) usage  
- Data transmission and reception  
- Polling-based communication  
- Real-time embedded protocol behavior

## 📡 Protocols Covered

### 🔹 UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver Transmitter)
- Asynchronous serial communication
- Baud rate configuration
- TX/RX operations
- Commonly used for debugging and PC communication

### 🔹 I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit)
- Two-wire protocol (SCL & SDA)
- Master mode implementation
- EEPROM byte read/write
- START, STOP, ACK, NACK handling

### 🔹 SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface)
- Full-duplex synchronous communication
- Master mode configuration
- Clock polarity (CPOL) & phase (CPHA)
- High-speed data transfer

### 🔹 CAN (Controller Area Network)
- Multi-node communication
- Message-based protocol
- Arbitration and error detection
- Widely used in automotive systems
